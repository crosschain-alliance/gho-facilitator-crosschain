## ⚠️ Security and Development Disclaimer

All contracts in this repository are still under active development. Although GHO Cross Chain Facilitator endeavors to ensure the highest level of security and reliability, the evolving nature of software development means that these contracts may contain unforeseen issues or vulnerabilities.

While we strive to provide a secure and robust platform through the integration of multiple oracles and other advanced features, it's crucial for users, developers, and integrators to understand the inherent risks associated with smart contracts and blockchain protocols.

All contracts have undergone thorough testing and reviews, but this doesn't guarantee they are free from errors or security vulnerabilities. Use them at your own risk.
